# FullstackOpen
Fullstackopen is a website (fullstackopen.com) made by a university in Helsinki for students all over the world, who wish to learn about the fullstack web development with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, Express, Cypress, Jest, MongoDB and more

In this Repository I keep pushing my results from the tutorial, as well as from the exercises.

Each part of the course has its own directory, which is then split further into 2 other directories. 

- A tutorial directory, where the code I wrote along with the turoial gets pushed

- An exercise directory, where you can see my approach at acomplishing each exercise of the course. 

If you are currently doing this course as well, and somehow found this repository by googling for the solution of an exercise which you were stucked in for a while, 
then I hope this repo will be able help u get further :)
